B. Draft
Title of the regulation  
The preliminary draft law concerning the introduction of an electronic application called “Federal Learning Account”.
Short description of the draft regulation, including its origin (treaty, directive, cooperation agreement, current events, ...), and the intended implementation goals.
The preliminary draft law aims to establish this Federal Learning Account and pays particular attention to the automated processing of personal data of employees included in this digital application. The law intends to create a legal obligation for data controllers to register and manage personal data.
The application will allow employees and employers to manage and track individual training rights and sectoral training rights, and to inform employees about them.
The application also provides employees, employers, and other authorized actors with information about the training days to which the employee is entitled, the training days taken, the training courses followed, as well as information about the training credit. Given the importance of training for individuals and the labour market, it is necessary that these data remain available throughout the entire career of persons active on the Belgian labour market. This means that the data in the Federal Learning Account must be available not only for employees but also for persons who, for example, were previously employees and have transitioned to self‑employment. This allows these persons to access their data should they wish to be employed again as workers.

What impact does the draft regulation have on these 21 themes?
1. Combating poverty
☒ Positive impact
☐ Negative impact
☐ No impact
Explain  
Training of employees is essential for the proper functioning of the labour market.
In 2017, this was reaffirmed at the European level by establishing, as the first principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, the right to high‑quality and inclusive education, training, and lifelong learning to acquire and maintain skills. A trained employee has a better chance of finding a quality job, thereby reducing the risk of poverty.
2. Equal opportunities and social cohesion
☒ Positive impact
☐ Negative impact
☐ No impact

Explain  
Training of employees is essential for the proper functioning of the labour market.
Based on this underlying objective, the Council of the European Union recommended that Member States develop individual learning accounts “as a means to enable individuals to participate in labour‑market‑relevant training and to provide a facilitating framework, including guidance and validation opportunities, to promote effective participation in such training.” These learning accounts therefore fit within the broader EU objective of “enabling more adults to participate in training, thereby increasing participation rates and reducing skills gaps,” with a view to “promoting a highly competitive social market economy aimed at full employment and social progress.”
